# Multi-Step Form with Progress Bar

This project demonstrates a multi-step form with a visual progress bar, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* **Multi-Step Form:** Divides a form into multiple steps for improved user experience.
* **Progress Bar:** Visually indicates the user's progress through the form.
* **Form Validation:** Includes basic input validation for each step.
* **Responsive Design:** Uses CSS for a clean and responsive layout.

## Files

* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the form.
* `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the form and progress bar.
* `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for form navigation and progress updates.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository or download the files.
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3.  Fill out the form, clicking "Next" to advance and "Back" to return to previous steps.
4.  The progress bar and step indicators will update accordingly.
5.  Click "Confirm & Submit" on the final step to submit the form (an alert will appear for demonstration).

## Customization

* Modify `styles.css` to change the form's appearance.
* Update `script.js` to add or modify form validation.
* Add more steps to the form by duplicating and modifying the existing form elements and updating the javascript logic.

## Notes

* The form submission in this example is simulated with an alert.
* Real-world applications would require server-side processing for form data.
